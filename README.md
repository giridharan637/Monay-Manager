This project is a simple and lightweight Expense Manager Web Application built using Python Flask, CSV files, and basic file handling techniques. The application allows users to securely register, log in, and manage their daily financial transactions such as income and expenses.

Edit or delete past transactions

Export transaction history as a CSV file
